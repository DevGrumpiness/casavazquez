## typescript

Never used typescript before? Don't worry! You will be fine. Actually you will love it. Everbody does! The code editor basically tells you what to do and prevents the app from crashing hard.

## github coespaces

You can clone th project locally or just use the magic of github codespaces.
Codescpaces basically runs a container in the cloud and connects to you VSCode.

## prettier.rc and eslint

To make things easier I configured eslint and prettier.
I recommend turning on "format on save" in you editor and choose "Prettier Code Formatter" as default formatter while working on this project.
